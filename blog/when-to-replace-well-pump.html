            <p>Your well pump is the heart of your water system. When it fails, you're without water—and emergency replacement costs significantly more than planned replacement. Here's how to recognize when your pump is failing and what to expect when it's time for a new one.</p>
            
            <h2>How Long Should a Well Pump Last?</h2>
            
            <p>Well pump lifespan depends on the type, usage, and water quality:</p>
            
            <table class="cost-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Pump Type</th>
                    <th>Typical Lifespan</th>
                    <th>Factors Affecting Life</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Submersible pump</td>
                    <td>8-15 years</td>
                    <td>Depth, sand content, cycling frequency</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Jet pump (shallow well)</td>
                    <td>10-15 years</td>
                    <td>Run time, pressure settings</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Pressure tank</td>
                    <td>10-15 years</td>

            </table>
            
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> If your pump is over 10 years old and showing any warning signs, replacement is often more cost-effective than repair. Repair costs can be 50-75% of replacement, and a repaired old pump may fail again soon.</p>
            
            <h2>7 Warning Signs Your Pump Needs Replacement</h2>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #1: Frequent Cycling (Short Cycling)</h3>
                <p>Your pump turns on and off repeatedly—every few seconds to minutes—even when water isn't being used heavily. This is often the first sign of trouble.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Usually indicates a failing pressure tank bladder, but can also mean the pump is struggling to maintain pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Check pressure tank first (cheaper fix). If tank is fine, pump may be wearing out.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #2: Decreased Water Pressure</h3>
                <p>Gradual decline in water pressure over months. Showers feel weaker, sprinklers don't reach as far.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Pump impellers are worn, reducing the pump's ability to push water.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> If pump is under 8 years old, may be repairable. Over 8 years, consider replacement.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #3: Air Sputtering from Faucets</h3>
                <p>Air bursts mixed with water, especially when first turning on a faucet.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Pump may be drawing air due to worn seals, or water level has dropped below the pump intake.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Have well inspected. May need pump lowered or replaced with deeper-rated pump.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #4: Sandy or Sediment-Filled Water</h3>
                <p>Water suddenly becomes sandy or you notice sediment in toilet tanks and at faucet aerators.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Pump is pulling sand from the formation, often due to a failing screen or a pump set too low.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Sand destroys pump internals quickly. Address immediately to prevent pump failure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #5: Unusually High Electric Bills</h3>
                <p>Significant increase in electrical usage without other explanation.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Worn pump runs longer to deliver the same water, or is cycling excessively.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> A new, properly-sized pump often pays for itself in energy savings within a few years.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #6: Strange Noises</h3>
                <p>Grinding, clicking, or loud humming from the well area or pressure tank.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Bearings failing, motor struggling, or electrical problems.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Strange sounds usually mean failure is imminent. Plan replacement soon.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="warning-sign">
                <h3>⚠️ Sign #7: Pump Runs Constantly</h3>
                <p>You can hear the pump running even when no water is being used.</p>
                <p><strong>What's happening:</strong> Either a leak somewhere in the system, or pump can't build enough pressure to shut off.</p>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> First check for leaks. If no leaks, pump is likely failing.</p>

            <h2>Repair vs. Replace: Making the Right Choice</h2>
            
            <p>Use this guide to decide whether to repair or replace:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Consider REPAIR if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pump is less than 5 years old</li>
                <li>Problem is electrical (capacitor, pressure switch)</li>
                <li>Issue is in accessible components (pressure tank, controls)</li>
                <li>Repair cost is less than 40% of replacement cost</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Consider REPLACEMENT if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pump is over 8-10 years old</li>
                <li>Multiple components are failing</li>
                <li>Repair requires pulling the pump from the well</li>
                <li>Same problem has occurred before</li>
                <li>Pump is undersized for current needs</li>
                <li>Energy costs are excessive</li>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Replacement Pump</h2>
            
            <p>When replacing your pump, consider these factors:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Match the Well Depth</h3>
            <p>The pump must be rated for your total pumping depth (well depth minus static water level, plus vertical rise to pressure tank, plus friction losses).</p>
            
            <h3>2. Calculate Required Flow Rate</h3>
            <p>Most California homes need 5-10 gallons per minute (GPM). Calculate based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of bathrooms (× 1.5 GPM each)</li>
                <li>Kitchen (1 GPM)</li>
                <li>Laundry (2 GPM)</li>
                <li>Outdoor irrigation (varies widely)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Consider Variable Speed Pumps</h3>
            <p>Variable speed (constant pressure) pumps cost more upfront but offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent water pressure regardless of demand</li>
                <li>Reduced energy costs (30-50% savings)</li>
                <li>Less wear from cycling</li>
                <li>Longer pump life</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Don't Oversize</h3>
            <p>Bigger isn't better. An oversized pump:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cycles more frequently</li>
                <li>Wears out faster</li>
                <li>Costs more to operate</li>
                <li>Can damage your well (pulls sand)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Replacement Process</h2>
            
            <p>Here's what to expect when having your pump replaced:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initial assessment:</strong> Contractor inspects well and current system</li>
                <li><strong>Quote:</strong> Written estimate including pump specifications</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Most jobs can be completed in one day</li>
                <li><strong>Pump removal:</strong> Old pump is pulled from well (takes 1-3 hours depending on depth)</li>
                <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Well condition is assessed, water level measured</li>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> New pump is installed and connected</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> System is tested for flow rate and pressure</li>
                <li><strong>Startup:</strong> Pressure tank is set and system is started</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Total time: Usually 4-8 hours for a straightforward replacement.</p>
            
            <h2>Finding a Qualified Contractor</h2>

            <h2>Extending Your New Pump's Life</h2>
            
            <p>Make your new pump last longer with these practices:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>✓ Install a sediment filter (change every 3-6 months)</li>
                <li>✓ Maintain proper pressure tank air charge</li>
                <li>✓ Fix any leaks promptly (reduces cycling)</li>
                <li>✓ Install a cycle stop valve or constant pressure system</li>
                <li>✓ Protect from power surges with a pump protector</li>
                <li>✓ Don't run the well dry (if water runs out, stop and let it recover)</li>
                <li>✓ Annual system check by a professional</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A well-maintained pump in good water conditions can last 15+ years. Neglected pumps in sandy or corrosive water may fail in under 5 years.</p>
